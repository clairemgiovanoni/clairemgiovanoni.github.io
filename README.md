I coded this sample outline of a portfolio before creating my actual portfolio. This exercise helped me get an idea of how I wanted my portfolio layout to look, and how to make a responsive grid in CSS that would allow my portfolio to be viewed on both web and mobile. I used the layout created in this portfolio as the inspiration for my UX Designer portfolio.
